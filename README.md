# 👵🏼 Timeless Strokes  

Timeless Strokes is an app created to raise children's awareness of the importance of storytelling, recounting events, and sharing drawings and photos with people who have Alzheimer's. Studies show that these practices can help with memory recovery and improve patients' quality of life.
